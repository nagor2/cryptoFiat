TransferFee for CDP transfer money, but doesn't lower fee accumulated..
Fuck, and this is real... 
(doesn't modify position itself)... 

    function transferFee(uint posID) public returns (bool success){
        Position storage p = positions[posID];
        require(!p.onLiquidation, "This position is on liquidation");
        uint256 fee = p.feeGeneratedRecorded + generatedFeeUnrecorded(posID);
        require(coin.transferFrom(p.owner, address(this), fee), 'Was not able to transfer fee. Insufficient balance or allowance. Try to allow spending first');
        return true;
    }
